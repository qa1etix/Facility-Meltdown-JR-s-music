# JR's 'London Bridge' theme for Facility Meltdown
Thanks to original mod dev and 3FS for track!
# !!! COFNIG !!!
## I changed these configs in advance, if the music doesn't work, it's better to change them manually

facilitymeltdownClient.cfg

    Set "MusicVolume" to "0"
    Set "MusicPlaysOutside" to "false"

pizzatowerescapemusic.cfg

    Set "Scripts" to "JRMUSIC"
    (If you wish to use Lethal Resonance Meltdown, set "Scripts" to "Default,JRMUSIC")
